Random Forest Regression Project üå≥
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building, tuning, and evaluating a Random Forest Regressor model using Python. It covers key stages from data preprocessing to hyperparameter tuning and insightful visualizations.

üéØ Project Goal
The primary objective is to predict a continuous target variable by leveraging a Random Forest Regressor and showcasing core machine learning practices:

Data Transformation: Using a log transformation on the target variable to handle skewness and improve model performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Implementing RandomizedSearchCV to efficiently find the optimal model configuration.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance with standard metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R¬≤ Score.

Visualization: Creating visualizations for model predictions, residuals, and feature importance to gain deeper insights.

‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/RajGani2925/California_hosuing_regression_model.git](https://github.com/RajGani2925/California_hosuing_regression_model.git)
cd RandomForest_Project

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter lab

Open the notebook file and run the cells sequentially to follow the project workflow.

üìä Key Visualizations
Actual vs. Predicted Plot: A scatter plot illustrating how closely the model's predictions align with the actual values.

Residual Analysis: Histograms and plots to check for bias and homoscedasticity in the model's errors.

Feature Importance Chart: A bar chart highlighting which features have the most influence on the model's output, providing valuable interpretability.
